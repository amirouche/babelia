# Ruse Scheme

**experimental**

## Babelia

Babelia is a privacy friendly, decentralized, open source, and
accessible search engine. Search has been an essential part of
knowledge acquisition from the dawn of time, whether it is antique
lexicographically ordered filing cabinets or nowadays computer-based
wonders such as Google, Bing, Yandex, and Baidu. From casual search to
help achieve common tasks such as cooking, keeping up with the news, a
regular dose of cat memes, or professional search such as science
research. Search is, and will remain, an essential daily-use tool, and
stires human progress forward.

Babelia aims to replace the use of privateer search engines with a
search engine that is open, hence under the control of the
commons. Babelia wants to be an easy to install, easy to use, easy to
maintain, no-code, personal search engine that can scale to billions
of documents, beyond a terabyte of text data, for under €100 a month
per Babelia instance.
